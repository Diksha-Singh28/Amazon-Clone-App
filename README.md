# Amazon-Clone-App
This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of front-end development and sharpen my skills in HTML and CSS. From replicating the user interface to ensuring responsiveness across various devices, I focused on every detail to make the clone as close to the original as possible.
